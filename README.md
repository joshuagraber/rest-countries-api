## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- REST API integration
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned a lot about React.js through this project, including handling API/JSON data, and using Router.


### Continued development

I feel that the search and sorting functions could be more smoothly integrated using React Router API. Once I feel more confident with Router (and / or Hooks), I plan to refactor using those techniques.


### Useful resources
